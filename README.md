Why this repository exists

This repository contains the initial experimental work that laid the foundation for what later became the Qazna open financial standard.

At the time of its creation, the project was developed as a startup prototype, exploring architectural, technical, and conceptual directions for a new type of financial infrastructure.

Over time, the project outgrew the startup framing and evolved into something more fundamental:

a vendor-neutral, open financial standard, comparable in role to how Linux functions in operating systems.

What happened next

The project has moved forward, both conceptually and structurally.

Development, documentation, and standardization now live in the canonical repository:

👉 https://github.com/qazna-org/qazna.org

That repository contains:
	•	the reference implementation,
	•	the formal standard documentation,
	•	governance-neutral principles,
	•	security, observability, and deployment models.

This archived repository remains intentionally preserved for historical and educational purposes.

Final note

Archiving this repository is not an end,
but a marker of transition:

from startup experimentation
to open standard evolution.
