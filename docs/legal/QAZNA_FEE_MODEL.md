## 1. Guiding Philosophy

The Qazna monetary system operates on the principle of **biological balance**, not profit accumulation.  
Fees and emissions are designed to preserve systemic equilibrium — similar to how blood circulation sustains a living organism.

---

## 2. Fundamental Principles

1. **Zero Emission Profit:**  
   Monetary emission exists solely to sustain liquidity and systemic health.

2. **Equilibrium-Based Commission:**  
   Fees are collected to maintain infrastructure, not to generate surplus income.

3. **Transparency and Reallocation:**  
   Every collected fee is automatically redistributed to sustain Qazna’s technical and security infrastructure.

4. **Continuous Adjustment:**  
   Fee coefficients adapt dynamically based on system load, network health, and economic indicators.

## 3. Participant Fee Tiers

| Participant Type | Fee Range | Description |
|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Sovereign Members (Central Banks)** | 0% | Full access without transactional fees. |
| **Certified Institutions (Banks, FinTechs)** | 0.01% – 0.05% | Minimal fee applied only to inter-jurisdictional settlements. |
| **Corporate Entities (MFOs, Corporations)** | 0.1% – 0.2% | Compensates computational and compliance costs. |
| **Retail and P2P Transactions** | 0% | Free micro and personal payments. |

## 4. Mathematical Model

Let:

- **T** = transaction volume (monetary units)  
- **Cᵢ** = base coefficient per participant type  
- **α** = network load factor (0.8–1.2 range)  
- **β** = systemic stress index (0.9–1.3 range)  

Then:

\[
Fee = T × Cᵢ × α × β
\]

Redistribution function:

\[
R = \sum (Fee × ωₙ)
\]

where **ωₙ** is the weighted allocation across system maintenance, redundancy nodes, auditing, and AI-based oversight.

## 5. Emission Balance Rule

Daily digital monetary emission **Eₜ** adjusts to economic growth **Gₜ** and energy efficiency **ηₜ**:

\[
Eₜ = Eₜ₋₁ × (1 + Gₜ × ηₜ)
\]

This ensures that currency supply expands only in proportion to real economic activity, maintaining equilibrium without inflationary distortion.

## 6. Transparency & Audit

- Real-time telemetry dashboard displays current fee flow and emission rates.  
- All balance sheets are cryptographically verifiable and timestamped.  
- External auditors have public read-only access to historical ledgers.  
- Reports published quarterly under **“Qazna Transparency Report”**.

---

## 7. Governance of Adjustments

- Coefficients α and β are recalibrated quarterly by the Technical Secretariat.  
- Any structural change in fee model requires approval by the Executive Board (2/3 majority).  
- Emergency reductions or waivers may be enacted to stabilize critical economies.

---

## 8. Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1:** Static coefficients (pilot countries).  
2. **Phase 2:** Dynamic AI-driven balancing.  
3. **Phase 3:** Fully autonomous adaptive system under continuous verification.
